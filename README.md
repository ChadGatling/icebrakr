# iceBrakr
Mobile dating app intended to remove as much of the initial barrier to meeting.

iceBrakr is for being introduced to people who are already out in public socializing near oech other.

iceBrakr will present the user with a slideshow of potential matches and she will indicate like or dislike. Anytime she "likes" someone who has "liked" her or someone she already "likes" "likes" her a match will be made. Users will be viewable when they are within a certain distance of each other and online. When a match is made the users will be notified and they will be shown each other's location on a map. The users who are already out in public will find each other at a certain location and meet. The users will be encouraged to interact for some amount of time before leaving and indicating their level of prefrence for each other, or staying together and continuing the date.

Potential to allow establishments to sponser and use their location as the meetup spot.

Once users are close enough to each other their phone screens will flash or turn a color to help them find each other.
